Google hasn't officially provided a zip version of the ADK 2.0 libs and the samples source code(like ADK 1.0).

This is to avoid the pain of using git+repo (especially with Windows).

The content of the zip has been downloaded as per instructions - http://developer.android.com/tools/adk/adk2.html
and it is highly encouraged to use that method to get the latest version of the code.
